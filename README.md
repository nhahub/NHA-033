## 📖 Project Overview
This project goes beyond traditional reporting. Our team simulated a real-world enterprise environment by adopting a **Domain-Driven Architecture**. Instead of working on isolated tasks, each team member acted as a **Lead Analyst** for a specific business vertical (B2B, B2C, Operations, etc.), managing the full data pipeline from SQL extraction to Power BI visualization.

The result is a unified **Decision Support System** for AdventureWorks management.
